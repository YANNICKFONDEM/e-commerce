Make sure you have Python installed on your system by typing the command below
pip install django

If you have an existing Django project, navigate to its directory.
cd marketplace

install the requirements.txt on your system by typing the command below
pip install -r requirements.txt

Inside the root directory of your Django project (where manage.py is located), run the following command
